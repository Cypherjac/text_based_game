## RULES

Items are collected in each room with different abiilties:

1 item from each room - from predetermined list of items/special abilities.

Examples:

1. Free pass
2. Free hint
3. Bonus score for 2 in a row
4. Bonus score for 3 in a row
5. Double score for most weighted challenge

The total sum of points on each path taken will amount to 100 points eventually

(This is without bonus) -- Bonus will be represented as additions to the total score

<br/>

Using a hint removes the expected score from that challenge by a predefined value, say -1

Using a pass removes a point from the total score, if no "free-pass" ability is selected.
